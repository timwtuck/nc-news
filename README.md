# Tim's News API

A repo for a project that I'm not entirely sure what it is yet, but pretty excited to find out.

# Set-up Instructions

To work on this project:

1.  Set up test/development data base
2.  Set up environment variables to point to databases

    - Need .env.test & .env.development files which reference the respective databases
    - These files contain a single line of PGDATABASE=your_data_base_name
